hey Emerald! I hope you’re doing well [emoji:smile] #Speaker: Amika
sorry, I know it’s really late lol #Speaker: Amika
do you remember those vocaloid videos we made back in high school? #Speaker: Amika
I just found a sketch of Memi in one of my notebooks #Speaker: Amika
Amika!!! Hey, it’s nice to hear from you! #Speaker: Emerald
I could never forget our little sun-shaped guy! #Speaker: Emerald
he’s still the mascot my vocaloid acct on YouTube #Speaker: Emerald
the one where we uploaded “Memories” [emoji:heart] #Speaker: Emerald

* I drew my BUTT off for that video! #Speaker: Amika
I was up every night working on it. I barely slept that month! #Speaker: Amika
I remember! #Speaker: Emerald

* well, you’re the one who wrote the song haha #Speaker: Amika
you were up every night after school animating the lyric video for a MONTH. that means it’s your song too! #Speaker: Emerald


- you were a great artist even back in high school. No wonder you got that awesome job in Burbank right out of college [emoji:heart] #Speaker: Emerald

* aww man thanks!! #Speaker: Amika
you totally deserve it! #Speaker: Emerald

* sometimes you get lucky haha #Speaker: Amika
stop, don’t sell yourself short! #Speaker: Emerald
seriously, don’t make me come all the way over there [emoji:mad] #Speaker: Emerald
okay, okay! I’m super-great and I deserve this extremely-cool job, please don’t hurt me haha [emoji:joy] #Speaker: Amika
that’s better lmao #Speaker: Emerald

- it’s really nice of you to text. I had no idea you were still thinking about all those old mascot characters and lyric videos we made #Speaker: Emerald
I don’t think I’ve touched my DAW in ages lol #Speaker: Emerald
how come? You always loved playing around with Miku, GUMI, and the others. #Speaker: Amika
I guess I haven’t really used voice synthesizers for anything since I started music school #Speaker: Emerald




- but anyways! Hbu? Are you still following [artist name], [artist name] and everybody? #Speaker: Emerald

*   I’m less into vocaloid now. #Speaker: Amika
        I just don’t have time for that kind of stuff anymore #Speaker: Amika
        totally, I'm super busy these days too! but always glad to keep you in the loop lol #Speaker: Emerald
        I appreciate it :) I'm pretty far out of the loop at this point though. like deep space #Speaker: Amika
        I'll rope you back in! like how they space lassoed matt damon in that movie #Speaker: Emerald
        haha good to know you'll always catch me up.#Speaker: Amika


*   I still love vocaloid! #Speaker: Amika
        I wish I could keep up with it more. I wouldn’t know any new songs unless you posted them haha #Speaker: Amika
        yeah I bet you’re busy living it up in Burbank! #Speaker: Emerald
        hardly lol more like busy trying to stay afloat #Speaker: Amika
       


- I'm really sorry I haven’t messaged more often. #Speaker: Amika
no worries haha #Speaker: Emerald
how’s California so far? don't tell me you say "stoked" and "beggle" now :O #Speaker: Emerald

*   it's great! and I don't lol #Speaker: Amika
        so great you’ll never come back haha #Speaker: Emerald
        sorry, I wanted to make it over the summer! #Speaker: Amika
	all the artists and animators are putting in extra time to get the new season out. I couldn’t get free [emoji:fearful] #Speaker: Amika
        I’m just giving you a hard time! maybe we can meet up over Thanksgiving? #Speaker: Emerald
        my folks are going to visit me out here actually . . . they want to escape the Illinois cold for a bit #Speaker: Amika
        oh that sounds fun. but I’m coming after you for that raincheck! #Speaker: Emerald
        absolutely! #Speaker: Amika

*   it’s been hard honestly. #Speaker: Amika
        everything's crazy. I haven’t been able to think straight or take a breath #Speaker: Amika
        aw man! hope you’re doing okay #Speaker: Emerald
        I’m alright, it’s just that working at an animation studio is somehow even harder than I thought it would be #Speaker: Amika
I feel like I’m playing catch up with everyone else and just trying to make it till the next deadline #Speaker: Amika
        I have no idea why they picked me. I might not be cut out for this #Speaker: Amika
        I felt the same about school you know #Speaker: Emerald
        wait high school or college? #Speaker: Amika
        both! #Speaker: Emerald
        are you kidding? or did I dream up all those amazing Chicago Youth Symphony recitals? #Speaker: Amika
dude those take me way back, that feels like forever ago [emoji:joy] #Speaker: Emerald
I know it’s crazy haha #Speaker: Amika
	


*   decent overall #Speaker: Amika
        I’m still getting in the groove #Speaker: Amika
        getting in those California vibes 😎 #Speaker: Emerald
        oh my gosh no I have no chill lately #Speaker: Amika
        um when did you have chill to begin with?? #Speaker: Emerald
        wow okay! drag me then #Speaker: Amika


- how about you? how are things back in Chicago? #Speaker: Amika
did you do anything fun during break? #Speaker: Amika
break? #Speaker: Emerald
your music program had fall break already right? #Speaker: Amika
oh yeah I didn’t do anything though lol #Speaker: Emerald
really? #Speaker: Amika

*   well rest is important! #Speaker: Amika
        LOL as if! sleep is for the weak #Speaker: Emerald

*   don’t get TOO lazy lol #Speaker: Amika
        there are no breaks after graduation, you know #Speaker: Amika
        thanks mom LOL I just didn't feel like doing anything special #Speaker: Emerald

*   busy with school then? #Speaker: Amika
        I guess. I'm keeping myself occupied #Speaker: Emerald

- what else are you doing this semester? #Speaker: Amika
not much #Speaker: Emerald
I mean not much compared to you!! #Speaker: Emerald
drawing all day and spotting celebrities, I’m jealous haha #Speaker: Emerald
no no it’s not like that! I’m just a prop artist, I don’t get to meet the voice talent. and all the spottings are over in silver lake xD #Speaker: Amika
you're closer to your dream than a lot of people get! you’re totally on your way to being a great director #Speaker: Emerald
directing might not be my dream anymore actually #Speaker: Amika
oh! did something happen? #Speaker: Emerald

*   no, just being realistic #Speaker: Amika
        it's harder to be disappointed if you reset your expectations #Speaker: Amika
        hmm. does giving up actually save yourself the disappointment or just front load it? #Speaker: Emerald
        what do you mean? #Speaker: Amika
        like are you actually changing your mind or are you letting your fear make the decision? #Speaker: Emerald
        if you don’t want to anymore that’s totally your choice! plans change. but I hope you’re not counting yourself out because you think you CAN’T do it. you’re an amazing artist, Amika! you have so much to be proud of already. if it means anything, I’M proud of you :) #Speaker: Emerald
        oh wow that means the world to me!! I appreciate you saying that Emerald, you always know how to cheer me up :) #Speaker: Amika

*   I’m not good enough #Speaker: Amika
        I'm nothing like the directors at my studio #Speaker: Amika
        what do you mean? #Speaker: Emerald
        I know I'm only starting out but I just feel invisible sometimes. I don't know why anyone would care what I have to say #Speaker: Amika
        isn't it worth sharing your stories even if it feels like no one's listening? #Speaker: Emerald
        if you don’t want to anymore that’s totally your choice! plans change. but I hope you’re not counting yourself out because you think you CAN’T do it. you’re an amazing artist, Amika! you have so much to be proud of already. if it means anything, I’M proud of you :) #Speaker: Emerald
        oh wow that means the world to me!! I appreciate you saying that Emerald, you always know how to cheer me up :) #Speaker: Amika

*   Nvm! Don't worry about it #Speaker: Amika
        I'm fine, everything's good #Speaker: Amika

- sorry for bringing things down #Speaker: Amika
you have nothing to be sorry for! #Speaker: Emerald
well if I ever do make a film you’re my first choice for music! I know you would write a killer score #Speaker: Amika
have you been working on any new songs for class? #Speaker: Amika
not really - I’ve actually been spending more time listening lately. #Speaker: Emerald
I’m working on a post right now about nostraightanswer, have you heard of them? #Speaker: Emerald

* I haven’t! #Speaker: Amika

* that rings a bell #Speaker: Amika

- nostraightanswer is a really good vocaloid artist! #Speaker: Emerald
I've had this song “Wishing Well” on repeat. I find it soothing, it’s been keeping me going this year. #Speaker: Emerald
soothing? how so? #Speaker: Amika
if you listen to it you'll see! if you need a pressure valve from the rush of the city it might help #Speaker: Emerald
plus, it has beautiful lyrics. I think about them a lot, actually #Speaker: Emerald
anyway sorry to head out so soon but I have to finish up this post and head off to work to work, I got stuck with the graveyard again rip #Speaker: Emerald
your school library has a graveyard shift?? #Speaker: Amika
oh I work off campus now! so yeah crazy hours #Speaker: Emerald
bummer . . . maybe they’re hiring somewhere else on campus? #Speaker: Amika
I checked but all the on campus jobs are taken actually #Speaker: Emerald
all of them? that sucks. #Speaker: Amika
but I really do have to go now, you should look up the song! #Speaker: Emerald

*   sure, I'd love to! :D #Speaker: Amika
        I'll give it a listen tonight #Speaker: Amika
        oh awesome!! lmk what you think! #Speaker: Emerald


*   I’ll see if I have time #Speaker: Amika
        hope you do :) #Speaker: Emerald


- anyway, I should go. but talk later? #Speaker: Emerald
definitely! I should probably get some sleep too #Speaker: Amika
maybe I’ll listen to nostraightanswer’s song while I lie down #Speaker: Amika
a soothing vocaloid lullaby [emoji:smile] #Speaker: Emerald
I guess so, lol! #Speaker: Amika
sweet dreams, and let me know if you have any more Memi sightings! [emoji:heart] #Speaker: Emerald
