hey Emerald this is Amika! guess what I found on my walk today . . . #Speaker: Amika
street art of Memi stenciled on an overpass!!! #Speaker: Amika
do you still remember him? #Speaker: Amika
Amika!!! hey! nice to hear from you :) I could never forget our little guy! I wonder what he's doing out west though? lol #Speaker: Emerald
I think I still have the notebook we drew him in! or maybe I left it at my parents during the move. I still haven't finished going through all the boxes tbh #Speaker: Amika
yeah I remember your car was packed to the brim! it's a miracle all your art supplies made it to California in one piece haha #Speaker: Emerald
btw what's your apartment like? I never got the pics #Speaker: Emerald
oh gosh I didn't mean to ghost! #Speaker: Amika

*   I've been busy with work! #Speaker: Amika
        I know you're having lots of new adventures! #Speaker: Emerald

*   work sucks up all my time #Speaker: Amika
        aw well I appreciate you taking the time to talk now! #Speaker: Emerald
        
- it's okay lol I forgive you ;)  #Speaker: Emerald
I live in a one bedroom close to a park so I see doggos almost every day #Speaker: Amika
it must be nice to have a place of your own! hopefully that's still possible for me #Speaker: Emerald
oh are you trying to move off campus this semester? #Speaker: Amika
yeah trying to move on! #Speaker: Emerald
but anyway that can’t really be Memi right? #Speaker: Emerald
it looks just like him but it's street art! who would have found our vocaloid mascot from high school? XD #Speaker: Amika
I mean I haven’t posted about him in a minute unless you have? #Speaker: Emerald
oh yeah I saw that you’ve kept up your vocaloid blog! I actually let mine drop off oops 😫 #Speaker: Amika

*   I’m less into vocaloid now. #Speaker: Amika
        I just don’t have time for that kind of stuff anymore #Speaker: Amika
        totally, I'm super busy these days too! but always glad to keep you in the loop lol #Speaker: Emerald
        I appreciate it :) I'm pretty far out of the loop at this point though. like deep space #Speaker: Amika
        I'll rope you back in! like how they space lassoed matt damon in that movie #Speaker: Emerald
        haha good to know you'll always catch me up. but wasn't I the one that got you into vocaloid in the first place?? #Speaker: Amika
        the mentor has become the student . . . how the turntables #Speaker: Emerald

*   I still love vocaloid! #Speaker: Amika
        I wish I could keep up with it more. I wouldn’t know any new songs unless you posted them haha #Speaker: Amika
        yeah I bet you’re busy living it up in LA! #Speaker: Emerald
        hardly lol more like busy trying to stay afloat #Speaker: Amika
        afloat in the pacific ocean 😜 #Speaker: Emerald
        I've only been one time since moving here! #Speaker: Amika
        that's more than me! I haven't been to the beach in like 10 years #Speaker: Emerald
        I promise I am a total west coast fraud lol. can't relax #Speaker: Amika

*   Hbu? Is yours still up? #Speaker: Amika
        oh yeah, I keep it updated! there's still a good community going #Speaker: Emerald
        Nice! #Speaker: Amika
        last time I logged on even more people had deactivated #Speaker: Amika
        we're a small but mighty group left! #Speaker: Emerald

- I'm really sorry I haven’t messaged more often. #Speaker: Amika
no worries haha #Speaker: Emerald
how’s California so far? don't tell me you say "stoked" and "beggle" now :O #Speaker: Emerald

*   it's great! and I don't lol #Speaker: Amika
        so great you’ll never come back haha #Speaker: Emerald
        sorry, I wanted to make it over the summer! but I didn’t have enough days off as a new hire #Speaker: Amika
        I’m just giving you a hard time! maybe we can meet up over Thanksgiving? #Speaker: Emerald
        my folks are going to visit me out here actually . . . they want to escape the Illinois cold for a bit #Speaker: Amika
        oh that sounds fun. but I’m coming after you for that raincheck! #Speaker: Emerald
        absolutely! #Speaker: Amika

*   it’s been hard honestly. #Speaker: Amika
        everything's crazy. I haven’t been able to think straight or take a breath #Speaker: Amika
        aw man! hope you’re doing okay #Speaker: Emerald
        I’m alright, it’s just that work takes up so much mental space. I feel like I’m playing catch up with everyone else and just trying to make it till the next deadline #Speaker: Amika
        I have no idea why they picked me. I might not be cut out for this #Speaker: Amika
        I felt the same about school you know #Speaker: Emerald
        wait high school or college? #Speaker: Amika
        both! #Speaker: Emerald
        are you kidding? or did I dream up all those Chicago Youth Symphony recitals? #Speaker: Amika
        oh my gosh! remember that blizzard on the way to sectionals?? #Speaker: Emerald

*   decent overall #Speaker: Amika
        I’m still getting in the groove #Speaker: Amika
        getting in those California vibes 😎 #Speaker: Emerald
        oh my gosh no I have no chill lately #Speaker: Amika
        um when did you have chill to begin with?? #Speaker: Emerald
        wow okay! drag me then #Speaker: Amika

- I knew there wouldn't be snow this time of year but I'm still getting used to it haha #Speaker: Amika
it feels so wrong for the month and the weather to not line up! #Speaker: Amika
but hey you get the Burbank sunshine to make up for it! now that the hour changed it’s dark here at like 5:00 pm #Speaker: Emerald
yeah I guess that’s a plus. did you do anything fun during break? #Speaker: Amika
break? #Speaker: Emerald
you guys had fall break already right? #Speaker: Amika
oh yeah I didn’t do anything though lol #Speaker: Emerald
really? #Speaker: Amika

*   well rest is important! #Speaker: Amika
        LOL as if! sleep is for the weak #Speaker: Emerald

*   don’t get TOO lazy lol #Speaker: Amika
        there are no breaks after graduation, you know #Speaker: Amika
        thanks mom LOL I just didn't feel like doing anything special #Speaker: Emerald

*   busy with school then? #Speaker: Amika
        I guess. I'm keeping myself occupied #Speaker: Emerald

- what else are you doing this semester? #Speaker: Amika
not much #Speaker: Emerald
I mean not much compared to you!! #Speaker: Emerald
drawing all day and spotting celebrities, I’m jealous haha #Speaker: Emerald
no no it’s not like that! I’m just a prop artist, I don’t get to meet the voice talent. and all the spottings are over in silver lake xD #Speaker: Amika
you're closer to your dream than a lot of people get! you’re totally on your way to being a great director #Speaker: Emerald
directing might not be my dream anymore actually #Speaker: Amika
oh! did something happen? #Speaker: Emerald

*   no, just being realistic #Speaker: Amika
        it's harder to be disappointed if you reset your expectations #Speaker: Amika
        hmm. does giving up actually save yourself the disappointment or just front load it? #Speaker: Emerald
        what do you mean? #Speaker: Amika
        like are you actually changing your mind or are you letting your fear make the decision? #Speaker: Emerald
        if you don’t want to anymore that’s totally your choice! plans change. but I hope you’re not counting yourself out because you think you CAN’T do it. you’re an amazing artist, Amika! you have so much to be proud of already. if it means anything, I’M proud of you :) #Speaker: Emerald
        oh wow that means the world to me!! I appreciate you saying that Emerald, you always know how to cheer me up :) #Speaker: Amika

*   I’m not good enough #Speaker: Amika
        I'm nothing like the directors at my studio #Speaker: Amika
        what do you mean? #Speaker: Emerald
        I know I'm only starting out but I just feel invisible sometimes. I don't know why anyone would care what I have to say #Speaker: Amika
        isn't it worth sharing your stories even if it feels like no one's listening? #Speaker: Emerald
        if you don’t want to anymore that’s totally your choice! plans change. but I hope you’re not counting yourself out because you think you CAN’T do it. you’re an amazing artist, Amika! you have so much to be proud of already. if it means anything, I’M proud of you :) #Speaker: Emerald
        oh wow that means the world to me!! I appreciate you saying that Emerald, you always know how to cheer me up :) #Speaker: Amika

*   Nvm! Don't worry about it #Speaker: Amika
        I'm fine, everything's good #Speaker: Amika

- sorry for bringing things down #Speaker: Amika
you have nothing to be sorry for! #Speaker: Emerald
well if I ever do make a film you’re my first choice for music! I know you would write a killer score #Speaker: Amika
have you been working on any new songs for class? #Speaker: Amika
not really - I’ve actually been spending more time listening lately. I’m working on a post right now about nostraightanswer, have you heard of them? #Speaker: Emerald
I haven’t! #Speaker: Amika
I've had this song “Wishing Well” on repeat. I find it soothing, it’s been keeping me going this year. #Speaker: Emerald
soothing? how so? #Speaker: Amika
if you listen to it you'll see! if you need a pressure valve from the rush of the city it might help #Speaker: Emerald
anyway sorry to head out so soon but I have to finish up this post and catch some sleep before heading to work, I got stuck with the graveyard again rip #Speaker: Emerald
your school library has a graveyard shift?? #Speaker: Amika
oh I work off campus now! so yeah crazy hours #Speaker: Emerald
bummer . . . maybe they’re hiring somewhere else on campus? #Speaker: Amika
I checked but all the on campus jobs are taken actually #Speaker: Emerald
all of them? that sucks. #Speaker: Amika
but I really do have to go now, you should look up the song! #Speaker: Emerald

*   sure, I'd love to! :D #Speaker: Amika
        I'll give it a listen tonight #Speaker: Amika
        oh awesome!! lmk what you think! #Speaker: Emerald
        ->END

*   I’ll see if I have time #Speaker: Amika
        hope you do :) #Speaker: Emerald
        ->END
